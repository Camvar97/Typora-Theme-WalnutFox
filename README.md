# WalnutFox Typora Theme
This is a theme that I made based on [Vue Dark Theme](https://github.com/blinkfox/typora-vue-theme) and the monokai colors.
Currently no plans to submit this to typora since it does use color codes from a pro theme out there that I dont want to get in possible trouble for.

You can custimize this theme by setting the `--primary-color` variable to the color that you want for the theme
